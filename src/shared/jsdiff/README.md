This directory is a copy of the current `master` of jsdiff and is temporary until
the release of jsdiff 6.0.0

See:
 - https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/446
 - https://www.npmjs.com/package/diff

jsdiff 5.1.0 is simply too slow to be usable in circumstances with large texts.

jsdiff 6.0.0 has a significant performance improvement that fixes that.
